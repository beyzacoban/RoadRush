Our game is a traffic simulation. Our map consists of buildings, roads and traffic lights. The aim is to ensure that a car leaving a building follows the right path and reaches the target building without colliding. We do this with the help of traffic lights. By changing the color of the lights at the intersection of the paths, we make the cars stop or move. Each colliding car increases the number of collisions by one. The car that reaches the end increases the score by one. The game ends when we reach the target number of cars to win or reach the maximum number of collisions.
